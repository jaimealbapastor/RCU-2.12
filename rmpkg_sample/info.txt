MyPackage

This is a sample application used to show other developers how to bundle
their applications inside the RMPKG format. This information section is
meant to include a Title on the first line, followed by a blank space,
then a Description through the rest of the document. Think of it like a
git commit message.

Perhaps it is beneficial to include information about the license of
your software, and a link to the project's website.
