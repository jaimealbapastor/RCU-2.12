reMarkable Package Sample
=========================
This directory contains scripts to build a sample package in the RMPKG
format. This is a self-contained, runnable script that implements:
  * Install itself (--install)
  * Uninstall itself (--uninstall)
  * List its manifest of touched files (--manifest)
  * Print its own information (--info)

The manifest of touched files is used by RCU to determine if two
packages conflict.

The package information is useful for anyone wanting to know what it
does. RCU uses this in tooltip hover text in the Software Pane.

To build this sample application, run `make`.
